/** NB: While Ref's can be stricter than just any Declaration (e.g.
  * Ref[Function]), we can construct any variant with just a Declaration. This
  * is because:
  *   - We cannot prove that the successor of a Declaration is of the correct
  *     type when we construct it: then it wouldn't be lazy and we wouldn't be
  *     able to cross-reference declarations out of AST order.
  *   - We do not want to cast or check refs to be of the correct kind every
  *     time we want to use it. The most acceptable solution is then to pretend
  *     to have a safe interface that returns a declaration of the right kind,
  *     but quietly check the type on first access.
