- [b] Cfg2Ast tests
- [s] finish parser
- [s] finish typechecker/resolver
- finish pretty printer
- error reporting when translating to Viper
- no parenthesis for prettyprinting unfolding, exists and condexp when possible
- many more consistency checks, in particular checks that are "less local" that types of sub-expressions
  - all variables used in methods/functions/quantifications are declared (formal arguments or locals)
- API consistency: typ appears in first and second argument list inconsistently
