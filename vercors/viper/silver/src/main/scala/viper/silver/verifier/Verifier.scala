import viper.silver.components.LifetimeComponent

/** An abstract class for verifiers of Viper programs.
  *
  * The lifetime of a verifier is as follows.  After the object has been created, `commandLineArgs` is called
  * at most once to set the command line arguments.  Similarly for `debugInfo` which is also called
  * at most once, either before or after `commandLineArgs`.
  * Afterwards, one or more calls to `verify` follow.
  *
  * RFC: [Malte] If we made this an abstract class, then `commandLineArgs` and `debugInfo` could
  *      be constructor arguments and we wouldn't have to impose a protocol on clients.
  *
  * RFC: [Malte] If we renamed method `verify` to something more generic, e.g., `handle`,
  *      then this trait could be generalised from `Verifier` to `SilProgramHandler` or
  *      `SilTool`.
  *
  * RFC: [Malte] In order to facilitate creating verifier instances by reflection, e.g.,
  *      by a frontend that has an option such as "--backend viper.silicon.Silicon",
  *      telling it to run the specified backend, we should prescribe a standard
  *      constructor, e.g., Verifier().
