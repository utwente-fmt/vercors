				<p style="text-align:justify"> At layer 3, VerCors combines data abstraction with process algebra and allows you to reason about abstract model by defining corresponding actions & processes with contracts. In the top layer the notion of history is added which allows us to verify functional properties in addition to data race freedom. A history captures abstractly the updates to data. Updates to histories are traced locally, and when threads synchronize, their local histories are merged into a global history, capturing the possible interleavings between the local updates. Note that functional properties could be accounted for using resource invariants and thread-locality only. However, this would give rise to large and complex invariants, because the invariant has to take into account how everything fits </p>

					<p style="text-align:justify">In the context of heterogeneous threading, verification of functional properties is a major challenge, requiring suitable abstractions. We have developed a technique to capture the behaviour of a shared memory concurrent program by means of a process algebra term. All accesses to the rel- evant shared memory locations are abstracted by actions. The process algebra term specifies what are the legal sequences of actions that are allowed to occur, and the program logic is used to verify that the process algebra term is indeed a correct abstraction of the program. Functional properties about the program can then be verified using algorithmic reasoning on the process algebra term.
