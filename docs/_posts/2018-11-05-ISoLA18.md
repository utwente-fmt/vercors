> **[ISOLA 2018](http://www.isola-conference.org/isola2018/) features several presentations around VerCors.**
>
> **[Marieke Huisman](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marieke/) presents the position paper ["On Models and Code - A Unified Approach to Support Large-Scale Deductive Program Verification"](https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/on-models-and-code/16231482).**
>
> In this paper, she argues that we need a seamless transition between models and code, and she sketches how the VerCors tool provides a first step towards this goal.

> **[Marieke Huisman](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marieke/) also presented the paper [Program Correctness by Transformation](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/program-correctness-by-transformation), co-authored by [Stefan Blom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEUh__sAAAAJ&hl=en), [Saeed Darabi](http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~darabis/) and <a href="" target="_blank">Mohsen Safari</a>**, which describes how the VerCors tool can be used to ensure that program transformations and optimisations preserve program correctness.

> **Finally, [Sebastiaan Joosten](http://sjcjoosten.nl) presented [Static Code Verification Through Process Models](https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/static-code-verification-through-process-models), co-authored by Marieke Huisman, which sketches an alternative approach for the use of abstractions to reason about concurrent software.**
