=======

This repository hosts VerCors, a toolset for the verification of concurrent and parallel programs. VerCors aims to verify many different concurrency constructs, including: heterogeneous concurrency (Java and C), GPU kernels using barriers and atomics (OpenCL), and compiler directives as used in deterministic parallelism (OpenMP). VerCors is able to prove data-race freedom, memory safety, and functional correctness of (concurrent) programs written in Java, C, OpenCL, OpenMP, and PVL (Prototypal Verification Language, a procedural toy language for prototyping new verification features). Moreover, VerCors is designed to be language-independent, which makes adding new front-end languages a straightforward engineering effort.

A list of verified examples and case studies is maintained online and can be found [here](https://utwente.nl/vercors). This webpage also contains an online interface for VerCors and allows you to try VerCors online.

### The tutorial can be found on the [VerCors Wiki](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki)!

# Installation
You can install VerCors by either using a release (recommended for beginners), or by building VerCors from its source code.

## Using a Release
VerCors requires a java runtime environment (version 11 or later), as well as clang if you want support for C.

### Linux
Currently we support debian-based systems; let us know if you need something else! Install the dependencies:

```shell script
sudo apt install clang openjdk-11-jre
```

Obtain the latest deb release of VerCors [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/releases/latest), and install it by running:

```shell script
sudo dpkg -i Vercors_x.y.z_all.deb
```

### Mac
You can for example obtain the dependencies through homebrew:

```shell script
brew cask install java
```

This should install the latest release of OpenJDK. Clang should already be installed through XCode.

Obtain the latest zip release of VerCors [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/releases/latest) and unzip it. You can find the run script for VerCors in the `bin` subdirectory.

### Windows
You can obtain a java runtime environment e.g. [here](https://jdk.java.net). Make sure that the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to wherever you unpack the JDK. clang can be obtained as part of the llvm toolchain [here](https://clang.llvm.org/). Make sure that `clang` is added to the path.

Next, download the latest zip release of VerCors [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/releases/latest) and unzip it. You can find the batch script for VerCors in the `bin` subdirectory.

## Building from source code
When building VerCors, you additionally need these dependencies:

- A Java _Development_ Kit, version 11 or greater, either OpenJDK or Oracle.
- Git (on Windows you need Git Bash, see <https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
- Scala SBT, version 1.3.0 or greater (see <http://www.scala-sbt.org> for instructions)

1. Clone the VerCors repository using `git clone https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors.git` and move into the cloned directory, `cd vercors`.
2. Run `sbt compile` to compile VerCors.
3. Test whether the build was successful by running `./bin/vct --test=examples/manual --tool=silicon --lang=pvl,java --progress`.

The last command tests the VerCors installation by verifying a large collection of examples (from the `./examples` directory). This command should eventually report that `all ? tests passed`. There are also intstructions for importing VerCors into either eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki).


# Running VerCors
VerCors verifies programs that are annotated with JML-style specifications (the underlying theory uses separation logic with permission accounting). Details on the specification language can be found on the VerCors [Wiki pages](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki). Furthermore, a large collection of example programs can be found (and verified) in the `./examples` directory.

The VerCors toolset can be used by running `vercors --silicon <filepath>`, with `<filepath>` the path of the (Java, C, or PVL) file to verify.
