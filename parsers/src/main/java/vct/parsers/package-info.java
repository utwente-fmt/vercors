/**
 * Interface to ANTLR4 parsers.
 * <p>
 * The entry point for using this package is the <code>Parser</code> class.
 * The <code>parse</code> method in this class will select a parser based
 * on the extension of the file name and call the appropriate ANTLR4 parser.
 * Next it will convert that ANTLR4 parse tree to a COL abstract syntax tree.
 * For languages that do not have a built-in specification language,
 * the next step is to scan the syntax tree for specification comments,
 * to parse those comments, convert them to COL and attach them in the
 * main syntax tree.
 * Finally, for some languages (E.g. Java) there is a post-processor
 * that has to be run to produce the correct AST.
 * <p>
 * The architecture for the conversion of an ANTLR parse tree to a COL
 * AST for the various languages is based on three levels. At the top
 * level, we have the <code>ANTLRtoCOL</code> class that provides
 * conversion for common features, such as sequences of declarations
 * and expressions. The middle level is the one shared by the specification
 * language and the programming languages. When using a separate grammar
 * for the specification language large part of the grammar are shared.
 * For example JML allows the same expressions as Java. The middle
 * level allow sharing the implementation of the parse tree conversion.
 * The lowest level is specific to each language.
 * <p>
 * The three layers are implemented with inheritance. The base class
 * is ANTLRtoCOL and implements ParseTreeVisitor, which makes it
 * a visitor for arbitrary ANTLR parse trees. The middle level
 * object extend this class with functions needed for a family of
 * languages. The language specific converter classes extend the
 * language family class and implement the generated language specific
 * visitor class.
 * <p>
 * To keep the implementation effort of the language specific visitor
 * down to a minimum, the code has been designed in such a way that
 * control flow starts with the base class, which calls the visitor
 * to check if the conversion is language specific (non-null return
 * value) or if it should use generic code (null return value).
